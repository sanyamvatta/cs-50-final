# GetQuizzed
#### [Video Demo:]  (https://website-name.com)
#### Description: Hello everyone. GetQuizzed is a simple web based quiz application. It contains multiple quizzes ( 3 as of today) but simple SQL queries can be used to add more. It is based on HTML, css, JavaScript for frontend . It also uses bootstrap for styling and some of its styles are also inspired by codepen.While for the backend and db it uses flask and SQL. It has login functionality and allows various users to give quizzes in different categories when they are logged in. If the user is not logged in he will only be able to access the about page of the website. When logged in the user will be able to gain full functionality. The users after giving the quiz will have their score evaluated and will be tested if they are the master or not. They can see thier history as well as their percentile rank in each quiz. Their is also a global leaderboard where different people/users can compete to be at the top of each quiz. each quiz is of 10 questions and a score from 0 to 40000 can be achieved. This is all of my app as of today. Thankyou.
